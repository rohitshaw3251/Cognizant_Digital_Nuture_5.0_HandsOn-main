# Week 1: Java FSE Hands-On Exercises

This folder contains the complete implementations for the mandatory hands-on exercises of Week 1, covering **Design Patterns and Principles**, **Data Structures and Algorithms**, **PL/SQL Programming**, **JUnit & Mockito (TDD)**, and **SLF4J Logging**. 

All implementations are flat (no nested package subdirectories) and comment-free to maintain direct clarity and learning.

---

## 1. Design Patterns and Principles

### Exercise 1: Singleton Pattern (`SingletonPatternExample`)
- **Logger.java**: Thread-safe Logger utility using private constructor, volatile static instance, and double-checked locking lazy initialization.
- **SingletonTest.java**: Test client validating instance uniqueness.

### Exercise 2: Factory Method Pattern (`FactoryMethodPatternExample`)
- **Document.java**: Product interface defining `open()`, `save()`, `close()`.
- **WordDocument.java**, **PdfDocument.java**, **ExcelDocument.java**: Concrete Product implementations.
- **DocumentFactory.java**: Abstract Creator defining the factory method `createDocument()`.
- **WordDocumentFactory.java**, **PdfDocumentFactory.java**, **ExcelDocumentFactory.java**: Concrete Creator implementations.
- **FactoryMethodTest.java**: Test client demonstrating document instantiation.

## 2. Data Structures and Algorithms

### Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function (`EcommerceSearch`)
- **Product.java**: Product model class with basic attributes.
- **SearchAlgorithms.java**: Linear search ($O(N)$) and binary search ($O(\log N)$) implementations.
- **SearchTest.java**: Test client sorting products and benchmarking execution times.

### Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting (`FinancialForecasting`)
- **FinancialForecasting.java**: Recursive algorithm predicting future values.
- **ForecastingTest.java**: Test client executing the recursive growth predictor.

---

## 3. PL/SQL Programming (`PL-SQL Programming`)

### Exercise 1: Control Structures
- **schema.sql**: Creates `Customers`, `Accounts`, `Transactions`, `Loans`, and `Employees` tables, and populates sample data.
- **Exercise1_ControlStructures.sql**: PL/SQL blocks for three scenarios:
  1. 1% discount to loan interest rates for customers over 60 years old.
  2. Promotes customers with a balance > $10,000 to VIP status.
  3. Displays reminders for loans due within the next 30 days.

### Exercise 3: Stored Procedures
- **Exercise3_StoredProcedures.sql**: Stored procedures for three scenarios:
  1. `ProcessMonthlyInterest` applying 1% interest to savings accounts.
  2. `UpdateEmployeeBonus` updating department salaries by a bonus percentage.
  3. `TransferFunds` transferring money checking balance requirements.

---

## 4. TDD using JUnit5 and Mockito (`JUnit and Mockito`)
- **AssertionsTest.java**: Basic assertions (assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse, assertNull, assertNotNull) as in Exercise 3.
- **AAATest.java**: AAA pattern demonstration using setup and teardown test fixtures (`@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`) as in Exercise 4.
- **ExternalApi.java** & **MyService.java**: Helper classes mimicking service dependency.
- **MyServiceTest.java**: Mockito mocking, stubbing, and interaction verification as in Exercises 1 & 2.

---

## 5. SLF4J Logging Framework (`SLF4J Logging`)
- **LoggingExample.java**: Basic logging showing error and warning level logging using SLF4J loggers as in Exercise 1.

---

## How to Compile and Run

To run the Java projects without IDE overhead, a helper script `download_jars.py` is included to fetch the required standalone JARs (JUnit 5, Mockito, and SLF4J Simple) into a local `lib/` directory.

### Step 0: Download Dependency Jars
Run the following from the root directory:
```bash
python week1/download_jars.py
```

### 1. Singleton Pattern Example
```bash
cd "week1/Design Patterns and Principles/SingletonPatternExample"
javac *.java
java SingletonTest
```

### 2. Factory Method Pattern Example
```bash
cd "week1/Design Patterns and Principles/FactoryMethodPatternExample"
javac *.java
java FactoryMethodTest
```

### 3. E-commerce Search Function
```bash
cd "week1/Data Structures and Algorithms/EcommerceSearch"
javac *.java
java SearchTest
```

### 4. Financial Forecasting Tool
```bash
cd "week1/Data Structures and Algorithms/FinancialForecasting"
javac *.java
java ForecastingTest
```

### 5. JUnit and Mockito Tests
```bash
cd "week1/JUnit and Mockito"
javac -cp "../lib/*" *.java
java -jar ../lib/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.10.2.jar -cp ".;../lib/*" --scan-class-path
```

### 6. SLF4J Logging Application
```bash
cd "week1/SLF4J Logging"
javac -cp "../lib/*" *.java
java -cp ".;../lib/*" LoggingExample
```
